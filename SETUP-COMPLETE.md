## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Step 1: Choose Deployment Option

**Option A: Azure App Service (Easiest)**
```bash
bash scripts/app-service-deploy.sh
```
- 5 minutes to deploy
- $50+/month cost
- Best for: Simple web apps

**Option B: Azure Kubernetes Service (Production)**
```bash
bash scripts/aks-deploy.sh
```
- 10-15 minutes to deploy
- $200+/month cost
- Best for: High availability, scaling

**Option C: Manual in Azure Portal**
- Follow: AZURE-DEPLOYMENT-OPTIONS.md
- Full control, step-by-step

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

Due to GitHub secret scanning, you need to:
1. Visit: https://github.com/shanumathew/shanuchatbot/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/34kvu1MxF6qdBJmCLeLYPMGRWQn
2. Click "Allow" to bypass protection
3. Run: `git push origin master`

### Step 3: Setup GitHub Actions (Optional)

For automatic deployments:

1. Go to: GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
2. Add secrets:
   - AZURE_CREDENTIALS (from `az ad sp create-for-rbac ...`)
   - AZURE_REGISTRY_USERNAME
   - AZURE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
   - AZURE_APPSERVICE_NAME
3. Workflows will auto-run on push

### Step 4: Test Your Deployment

After deployment, you'll get a URL:
- **App Service**: `https://react-chatbot-app.azurewebsites.net`
- **AKS**: `http://<LoadBalancer-IP>`
